# Bouncing Droplet

I worked as a Research Assistant at APU (Azim Premji University, Bangalore) during Sept 2020 - Sept 2021. My work entailed the simulation of the Bouncing Droplet setup, that I had created in the course of my Bachelors' thesis at APU. This is a report of my work containing different programs and their outputs with explanations.

The physical experiment is an oscillating petri dish containing silicone oil, where one has control over the amplitude and frequency. The system is fixed at a frequency and the amplitude is slowly increased, and beyond a certain threshold, one can observe faraday instability on the surface of the oil. The principle is that when the amplitude is kept right below the threshold of the instability, one can pluck the surface with a sharp object to create droplets of the oil. These droplets upon collision with the surface, do not coalace because of silicone oil's high surface tension. The droplets excite localised faraday instabilities, which induces lateral motion in the droplets and one can observe very interesting motion of these droplets.

The simulaiton attempts to explain the physical aspects of the motion to verify observations.
